# Prototype university-api

This is a prototype specification that we are using to drive a conversation forward around generating useful educational data for Learning Analytics. This repo builds off of an early [post by George Kroner](https://edutechnica.com/2015/06/09/flipping-the-model-the-campus-api/) that proposed the idea - we are planning to push the idea and see how far we can go! 

## Some design choices we have made in building out this specification



## Helpful resources to guide the development of this repo
