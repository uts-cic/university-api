# Prototype university-api

This is a prototype specification that we are using to drive a conversation forward around generating useful educational data for Learning Analytics. This repo builds off of an early [post by George Kroner](https://edutechnica.com/2015/06/09/flipping-the-model-the-campus-api/) that proposed the idea - we are planning to push the idea and see how far we can go! 

## Some design choices we have made in building out this specification



## Helpful resources to guide the development of this repo

- SoLAR position paper on [Generating Data for LA Ecosystems](https://www.solaresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SoLAR_Position-Paper_2020_09.pdf).
- The [final report]() from the OLT funded [Learning Analytics beyond the LMS]() project, along with the [GitHub resources]() (which are fairly depreciated now).
- The JISC LA project and [GitHub resources]() (which are fairly depreciated now).
