  title: University API [DEMO]
  version: 0.1.0
  description: >
    The University-API is a forward-thinking prototype geared towards standardizing 
    educational data for Learning Analytics. Stemming from George Kroner's visionary 
    [post](https://edutechnica.com/2015/06/09/flipping-the-model-the-campus-api/), 
    this project emphasizes harmonious data grouping, irrespective of its origin, 
    and insists on capturing detailed event contexts. As we sculpt and refine this 
    specification in real-time at the ALASI23 workshop, we warmly invite contributions 
    from the community to help shape the future of Learning Analytics.
